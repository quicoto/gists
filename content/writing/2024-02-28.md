It loops through all the jpg images in the folder and converts them to AVIF with the given configuration of quality and size.

It requires [libavif](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif) to be installed on the machine. If you're on MacOS [grab it on Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libavif).
